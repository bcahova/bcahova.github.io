<p><b>Newsagent inside of block of flats </b></p>

<p><b>(2015, Obchodn√≠ projekt Jihlava spol. s r.o.) </b></p>

<p>There is a current newsagent on the same spot as the designed one. Investor wanted to use the whole land he bought with the current newsagent and he wanted to have possibility of accommodation in there. Newsagent is a contrast against the block of flats around it - it has much smaller size, it has gabled roof and it has gabled walls of glass. A surface of the newsagent is designed to look like breaded in newspapers.</p>

<p>In the entrance floor there is a space for newsagent, in the second floor there is a place for accommodation.</p>
