<p><b>Sustainable landscape design in Brno - Černovice</b></p>

<p><b>(2014, BUT)</b></p>

<p>This landscape design solves empty space in Brno - Černovice between Olomoucká and Černovická street. There is a big slope on this land so there are terrace houses on the top of the land, where the slope is biggest and apartment building are place on the lower part of the land, where the slope is milder. There are also underground buildings in the middle of the design - shops and afternoon activities for kids. On the nearest spot to the city centre there is a big sports centre. There are also placed towers where is a nice view to the city centre of Brno </p>

<p>Sustainibility consists three parts: economy part, ecology part and social part. In this project economy part means that the land is used as it is, there are no big changes, no big excavations. For ecology part there is using sustainable energy, underground buildings, using grey water inside of the houses and a lot of green places. For social part there is a big sports centre, new cycle paths, parks and meeting point in front of the underground buildings - shops and afternoon activities for children. On this meeting point there can be local markets or concerts.</p>

<p>All buildings are designed as they could use renewable energy - heating pumps, solar collectors and solar photovoltaic panels. Green roofs help the buildings to low heat losses and collect rain water.</p>
